# Java 1

## Techniques for learning new languages

1. Java compiler
    1. why java is platform independent
2. Hello World with println
    1. print strings and other primitive data types
    2. concate string and other data types (concatenation)
3. Variables and Data types. Introducing Data Types and Operators p.31
    1. all primitive data types and "String"
    2. What is the difference between "String" and "char"
    3. What are two types of variables in Java?
    4. How many primitive data types in Java?
    5. How to make a constant and why
    6. How to init a few vars in one line
4. Math operations like \* / - +
5. Methods
    1. What are parameters and arguments of a method
    2. What is a type of a method and how to return a value
6. If statement. Comparison Operators (< <= > >= == !=). Logical Operators (&& ||)
    1. else with if

## MVP

1. Create variables of all primitive data types (and String) and initialize them
2. Write a method that calculates a \* (b + (c / d)) and returns a result where all variables (a, b, c and d) are parameters of this method
3. Write a method that takes two integers as parameters and checks that the sum of these two numbers is between 10 and 20. If so return true, otherwise false
4. Write a method that takes an integer and checks whether this number is positive or negative. (Zero is positive)
5. Write a method that takes a string called "name" as parameter and prints a message "Hello, {name}!". to the terminal
6. Write a method that determines whether the year is a leap year and outputs a message to console. Every 4th year is a leap year, except for every 100th, and every 400th - leap year.
